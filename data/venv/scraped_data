Welcome back to another school year! School buses are on the road again. Thank you for your patience during this busy time.
Due to a gas leak on Moodie Dr. some First Student Routes (starting with H &amp; C) may experience delays as buses are stuck at the bus yard.
Some Stock routes (starting with S) may also experience delays. Be advised that parents may need to drive their child to school this morning
Wait for the bus at a safe place away from the road. In less than clear weather conditions, it is easier for the driver to see you.
Fall has arrived. Make sure your child is dressed for the weather, so they are warm while waiting for the school bus.
KG ID bands have been distributed to all schools. The bright yellow bands help identify KG students riding the bus. Look out for them!
Parents and/ or guardians are urged to meet their child at the bus stops each day, so they aren't left unattended. Student safety first.
OSTA will start reviewing stop change requests as of October 1st. See details at: http://t.co/OR1C9F8S. We appreciate your patience.

By law, traffic in BOTH directions MUST stop any time a school bus is stopped with the overhead red lights flashing &amp; stop arm activated.
It's a $2,000 fine for breaking this law. Motorists may proceed when the school bus resumes motion &amp; the red lights have stopped flashing
It is important all parents and students recognize that the 3-metre perimeter around the bus is considered the danger zone. #safetyfirst
Poor road conditions due to inclement weather force the cancellation of our transportation services; cancellations apply to the whole day.
One element of OSTA's school bus safety program is the important role parents share in reinforcing school bus safety.
Please take the time to review safety procedure with your child several times throughout the school year. #safetyfirst
